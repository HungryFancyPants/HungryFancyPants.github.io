    <h2>VideoSlideshow</h2>
    <p>One enhancement applied to the website is a slideshow, which is located on the thanks.html page that the user receives after he/she submits the form of the website. The slideshow cycles through 5 different videos; sourced from Envato Elements. The videos are stored in an array using javascript and functions were used to call them on the webpage. The video cycles through  all of them in 9 sec of interval

    <h2>Displaying Current Date and Time</h2>
    <p>The website proves dexterity by making the enquiry process easier for users. This task is accomplished by automatically pre filling the value set in the date and time, with the current date and time. This saves the user from having to go through the work of looking up this information. This enhancement is scripted in Javascript. It is implemented when the function displayDateTime() is called. The format of the date is set as DD:MM:YYYY, and the time as Hours: Minutes.
Page Implementation:
1.Enquiry Page
